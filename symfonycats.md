# SymfonyCasts Rebrands as SymfonyCATS!

Great news! Our last rebranding from KnpUniversity to SymfonyCasts went *so* well
that we decided to do it again! Today, we're thrilled to announce our new name -
SymfonyCATS - and a renewed focus on what's most important to you while at work:
watching great tutorials while surrounded by pictures of cats.

After years of making tutorials, we'd like to think that we've gotten pretty good
at making them fun, understandable and useful. Well... we were wrong. After talking
with Ponka (Victor's cat), we've learn that there are a few things that are even
*more* important when trying to learn a new skill. They are, in order of priority
(approved by Ponka):

* shrimp
* tuna
* naps

So, on this April 1st, take some time to enjoy the things that really matter...
to your cat.
