One of our goals at KnpUniversity is make technology fun and accessible
to as *many* people as possible, including tech beginners, students and non-native
English speakers. Because... great tech should be available to *everyone*!

We already include the script content and our magic code blocks below each video
for *free*. But we also wanted to make the video itself more accessible and easier
to understand.

## English Subtitles / Captions

That's why all new videos *now* ship with English subtitles! Just hover over the
video and find the `[CC]` button in the bottom right. Couldn't quite understand
that word or phrase we just said? Just turn on the subtitles and keep going! The
captions include all the correct technical words and formatting.

## Video Thumbnails while Seeking

Have you ever tried to find an exact *part* of a video? To make that easier, we've
also added video thumbnails that show up as you move the cursor over timeline. Look
around, find the spot you need, and go!

I hope these little upgrades will make your life just a *little* bit more awesome
here on KnpUniversity. Have other suggestions? Let us know!

Cheers!
