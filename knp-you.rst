KnpYou
======

For the past few weeks, I've been *scouring* the web to learn everything I
can about REST. I've spent hours watching presentations, reading blog posts,
scanning RFCs (scary!) and bothering smart people directly. And after all
that time and effort, I'm still putting the pieces together.

Sometimes, learning something technical is just plain hard. Information is scattered,
opinions vary, and best-practices are buried. Nothing tells the whole, realistic
story of how something (fill in any tech topic, REST, Symfony2, Testing, etc) looks
in a real world application.

And **all the information is out there**! It's in blog posts, presentations and the
brains of smart people. So why can't we put it all together into one complete example
of how to do something correctly? We work together on open source libraries we all
use, but why not on real-life tutorials?

Opening up and Collaboration
----------------------------

And even though we're really proud of our tutorials, until now, we've worked on
them in isolation. In fact, almost everyone on the web operates around this old
idea of writing and releasing content in their own little silos.

So now, we're excited to enter our next phase, our rebellious, hyper-social,
experimental college years if you will. It's less about us, and a lot more about
finding out how we can work together.

What do I mean? Let's use some friendly bullet points:

* **Opening up on GitHub** - Until now, the script and code have been
  totally closed. It was a model of "us the writer" and "you the reader".
  That's silly, so we're now in the process of releasing 100% of the script
  and code from every screencast (you can already peak at `our GitHub`_).
  We're also going to open source more code and parts of the KnpUniversity
  site itself and share experiences (e.g. server stuff). In fact, this blog
  is `sourced from GitHub`_.

* **Everyone is an Author** - Wherever good tutorials live, it *must* be
  possible for anyone to update or even create new, high-quality coding stories.
  We're not there yet, but we *are* working with some really smart people
  (`Brent Shaffer (OAuth)`_, `Saša Stamenković (Sylius)`_) on new content.
  If you've got a topic you know a little bit about, then we'd love to open
  this site up for your tutorial as well (email us: hello@knpuniversity.com).
  We need to be even more open and that's in the works.

* **Coding Activities** - Watching a complete tutorial is better than reading
  a book. But nothing is better than actually coding yourself! We're poking that
  box by adding activities to our `Twig`_ course, with
  PHP activities coming very soon! This is something that we'll offer on every
  tutorial so that we can make learning these techy things as easy as possible.
  We're still figuring out how this should all look and work, so give us
  some feedback!

* **Transparent Tutorial and Coding Process** - Instead of working on tutorials
  and new site features like we're a cold war-era country, it's time to open up!
  This is still a WIP, but we *will* post new tutorials on GitHub as we're working
  on them and use the blog to discuss new features and progress. If we can do
  something to be more transparent, we'll try it!

Like when we started, we don't know where this will all lead, but we *do* know
that we're *really* *silly* excited! It means we get to share more and collaborate
with really smart people. And it's a challenge to us to open up as much of our code,
scripts and processes as possible.

Thank you!

We started KnpUniversity way back in December 2011 to prove that combining
Symfony screencasts with corny humor was a rather silly idea. To make sure
we failed, we originally forced you to download a huge video file (no streaming),
didn't give you a script, and spread out releases over a long period of time.

But somehow, you're still here, reading this. And for that, we're embarrassingly
thankful :).

Cheers!
