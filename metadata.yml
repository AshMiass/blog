            Sometimes, learning something technical is just plain hard. Information
            is scattered, opinions vary, and best-practices are buried. Nothing tells
            the whole, realistic story in a real world application. We work together
            on open source libraries, but not on tutorials.
            
            So now, we're excited to enter our next phase, where it's all
            about collaboration and working together!

        title: What the Rest?

            REST is as deep as the rabbit hole, with varied approaches and undefined
            best-practices. Should I use custom hypermedia types or something
            like HAL or JSON-LD? Should I implement OPTIONS? What role
            should the API documentation play and what information should be described
            inside the API itself? In this post, I'm asking for help.

            We're releasing the content of our screencasts and we want to get the
            license right. In this post, we give a little background and ask for
            your thoughts.

        title: REST Revisited

            After our recent "What the REST" post, a lot of people came out
            to help answer the most difficult questions around creating a
            RESTful API. In this post, I outline what we learned and what
            questions remain before we release our REST tutorial.

            We have an RSS feed! Ok, that's not earth-shattering, but
            we will be sharing tech experiences, updates, and other tech
            topics and we don't want you to miss out. We also talk about
            the code behind the RSS.

            At SymfonyCon Warsaw, I talked about RequireJS, Bower and Grunt
            in your PHP project. In this post, we'll go a bit further and
            check out a way to organize things that may be even better!
