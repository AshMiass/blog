            Sometimes, learning something technical is just plain hard. Information
            is scattered, opinions vary, and best-practices are buried. Nothing tells
            the whole, realistic story in a real world application. We work together
            on open source libraries, but not on tutorials.
            
            So now, we're excited to enter our next phase, where it's all
            about collaboration and working together!

    "what-the-rest":
        title: What the Rest?
        published: 2013-09-04
        preview: |
            REST is as deep as the rabbit hole, with varied approaches and undefined
            best-practices. Should I use custom hypermedia types or something
            like HAL or JSON-LD? Should I implement OPTIONS? What role
            should the API documentation play and what information should be described
            inside the API itself? In this post, I'm asking for help.

        title: REST Revisited
        published: 2013-09-17
        preview: |
            After our recent "What the REST" post, a lot of people came out
            to help answer the most difficult questions around creating a
            RESTful API. In this post, I outline what we learned and what
            questions remain before we release our REST tutorial.

            We have an RSS feed! Ok, that's not earth-shattering, but
            we will be sharing tech experiences, updates, and other tech
            topics and we don't want you to miss out. We also talk about
            the code behind the RSS.

            At SymfonyCon Warsaw, I talked about RequireJS, Bower and Grunt
            in your PHP project. In this post, we'll go a bit further and
            check out a way to organize things that may be even better!

        published: 2014-01-10
        preview: |
            Inspired by an old StackOverflow post, we'll investigate why
            it's so hard to get *all* of the errors of a form and unlock
            some new tricks by understanding the form hierarchy.

        preview: |
            Collaboration on software is *huge*, and we all enjoy the benefits.
            So why don't we see more with documentation? I'll tell you where
            I think tutorials & collaboration are going and what prevents
            us from getting there. But I also want to know what keeps *you*
            from writing tutorials and collaborating.

            a happier and more productive developer. But don't wait for its
            release to kick butt in the new world. That's right, just learn
            Symfony.

            Composer's require command just learned how to guess the best
            version for you. So update your library docs to have a one-line
            installation! And then have a sandwich.

        preview: |
            The new AppBundle in Symfony is controversial, but I'm not sure
            it should be. In this post, I'll show you why it exists, why
            bundles are just directories, and how close we are to having
            *no* bundles at all. Sound crazy? It might just change the way
            you think about your app.

            I switched from Assetic to Gulp to get more features and better
            support. In this post, I'll' tell you why there's a good chance
            that switching to Gulp is a good decision for you too. And, I'll

            Did you know you can inject a Doctrine repository into a service
            without registering it as a service? How about injecting scalar
            values are arguments that live in the database? If not, you may
            have missed Symfony's Expression Language.
