# Introducing: Cat GPT

You've heard of AI, but what if we told you there's a much more
PURR-vasive coding companion lurking right in your own home? That's right,
forget neural networks, it's time to take advantage of the ultimate reservoir
of untapped potential: your cat. Today, we at Symfonycasts are excited to
announce the launch of our groundbreaking new feature: Cat GPT, or
Generative Pre-trained Tetrapod.

Our world-class team of feline researchers and engineers has been working
tirelessly (in between naps, of course) to develop a state-of-the-art
cat-to-human language translation system. Now, you can access all our
video tutorials in "Cat" language! Simply select "Cat" from the language
drop-down, place a delicious offering of tuna in front of your computer,
and watch as your furry friend becomes a Symfony expert!

We can't wait to see the incredible creations born from our feline
programming prodigies. Just remember to keep your cat's claws trimmed... in
case they get *too* smart and try to take over the world.
