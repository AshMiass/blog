# SymfonyCasts is here to Listen

We are inspired and motivated by the message and momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement
that is happening worldwide and in the US, where we are headquartered. The outpouring
of empathy we have seen is incredible and we are here wanting to learn, listen and do better.

 - On June 2nd, as a company we made a donation to the [NAACP](https://naacp.org) (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) which was matched 100% by Google
 - We're reading to expand our knowledge on the issue. A few books that we are starting with include:
    - [White Fragility: Why It’s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism](https://robindiangelo.com/publications/)
    - [Me and White Supremacy: Combat Racism, Change the World, and Become a Good Ancestor](https://www.meandwhitesupremacybook.com/)
    - [I’m Still Here: Black Dignity in a World Made for Whiteness](https://austinchanning.com/books)
    - [Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race](https://renieddolodge.co.uk/books/)

We're human, imperfect and doing our best to grow & hear others. We recognize that
we have benefited from the current system and we hope we can use our platform to help
amplify the voices of others who have not. If you'd like to share, discuss or have
any comments on this, please message me: [ryan@symfonycasts.com](mailto:ryan@symfonycasts.com).
