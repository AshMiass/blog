Expanding Code Blocks
=====================

We've always published the scripts for each screencast publicly in the page
*and* included code-blocks so you can follow along. But naturally, sometimes
code blocks have typos, or you lose context. What file is this? Does this
code come before or after this other stuff?

So, our code blocks got a face-lift: with the exact filename always on top,
line numbers, and folded lines to show context. What to see those folded
lines? Just click them and they'll expand, a-la GitHub. The code comes from
the *actual* project that was built behind the scenes. So, you're seeing
the real thing.

Only new code-blocks have this, and you can see an example in the second
half of REST Episode 2 - like in our `HATEOAS Linking`_ chapter.

I'm not sure how many people read through the code-blocks now, I'd love to
hear if this is helpful.

Cheers!
