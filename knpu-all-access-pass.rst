All Access Pass at KnpUniversity
===========================================

The KnpU All Access Pass ... ooohhh ahhhh

It's been something I've been excited to implement for a while and it's 
finally here!

Offering a monthly and yearly all access pass is awesome because it frees us 
up to create more frequent smaller tutorials that cover very specific PHP, 
Symfony and other development topics for you! 


What you can expect
-------------------------------

More frequent content! We are excited to keep creating lots more
tutorials for you. A few examples of we've published recently include:

`Symfony Best Practices`_

`Symfony Voters`_

`Enjoy Fixtures with Alice and Faker`_

Coming up next is:

`Episode 2 of REST in the Real World`_

A few questions you may have if you already own Tutorials from KnpU:

Q: Can I still buy tutorials individually?

Yes! You will still have the option to buy tutorials individually.

Q: What if I already own some tutorials? Do I get to keep access to them?

Yes! You will continue to have access to the content you have already purchased, just the same as before.

Q: Why should I get an all access pass?

Well, funny you should ask, tons of smaller tutorials will be added soon making 
the all access pass the easiest way to gain access.

Q: When can I start a subscription?

November 17th!
