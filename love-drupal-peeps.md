First, HAPPY BIRTHDAY DRUPAL 8. OMG!! Go play with it, get started down our
[Drupal 8 Tutorial Track](http://knpuniversity.com/tracks/drupal), then come back.
This means you too Symfony people - Drupal 8 is actually pretty darn cool.

But what's *even* better than the release? This will sound like touchy-feely garbage,
but it's true: the Drupal people. This is a special group, let me tell you why.

## The First Time I Met Drupalers

The first time I met the Drupal community in real life was during a [Behat](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/behat)
talk for DrupalCon Portland. This was a new community for me, and my goal was simple:
teach them something about Behat and get them excited. Bah! Get them excited? How
clearly I did *not* know Drupalers yet. At a crucial moment, I prepared to show
a feature in dramatic fashion: hoping to enliven an audience that was now *two* full
days into a conference. But I never delivered that big moment. Instead, I flipped
the slide and the entire room - packed hundreds deep - erupted in applause. I stood
smiling, dumb-founded.

I've been to every DrupalCon since and [DrupalCamp Mexico](http://drupalcamp.mx/).
And each talk is the same: people climbing over each other to take photos of the
slides, packed rooms, and insightful questions. And of course, there's also the
DrupalCon [Prenote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zvCOKzY3kA)... one of the most
ridiculous, but fun things I've ever witnessed.

When Drupal chose to integrate Symfony, that was of course great. But the people,
they're better than I could have hoped for.

A few are so awesome, I have to call them out. First, our best friend
[Larry Garfield](https://www.drupal.org/u/crell), the amazing people-connector
[Cathy Theys](https://www.drupal.org/u/yesct), Mr [Drupal Console](https://knpuniversity.com/screencast/drupal8-under-the-hood/drupal-console-route-cache)
[Jesus Olivas](https://www.drupal.org/u/jmolivas) and of course, the famous mustachioed
(and wonderfully generous) [jam](https://www.drupal.org/u/horncologne).

So, happy birthday Drupal 8! Now let's all build something amazing, together.
