# All About the All Access Subscription Pass

Introducing binge-watching and more frequent content:

The KnpU All Access Pass ... ooohhh ahhhh

It's been something I've been *really* excited to get for a while and it's
finally here (or will be on Nov 17th). If you want to binge-view everything
before a new project, that's great. Do it! Seriously, that would be impressive.

Offering a monthly and yearly all access pass is awesome because it frees
us up to create more *frequent* tutorials that cover very specific PHP,
Symfony and other development topics. In web-dev speak, we can deploy content
early and often.

## What you can expect

More frequent content! We are excited to keep creating frequent and specific
tutorials for you. A few examples we've published recently include:

* [Symfony Best Practices](https://knpuniversity.com/screencast/symfony-best-practices)

* [Symfony Voters](https://knpuniversity.com/screencast/symfony-voters)

* [Enjoy Fixtures with Alice and Faker](https://knpuniversity.com/screencast/alice-fixtures)

Coming up next is:

## Questions?

A few questions you may have if you already own Tutorials from KnpU:

**Q: Can I still buy tutorials individually?**

Yes! You will still have the option to buy tutorials individually.

**Q: What if I already own some tutorials? Do I get to keep access to them?**

Yes! You will continue to have access to the content you have already purchased, just the same as before.

**Q: Why should I get an all access pass?**

Well, funny you should ask, tons of smaller tutorials will be added soon making
the all access pass the easiest way to gain access.

**Q: When can I start a subscription?**

November 17th! [Pricing](https://knpuniversity.com/pricing)

Now, go build something amazing!
