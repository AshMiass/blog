Hi friends!

I have some bad news. On March 11th I went to the emergency room after
losing motor control of my left arm and leg. Doctors identified a 5cm
tumor and removed most of it 2 days later. Since then, I've spent 3
weeks relearning how to use my left arm, type and walk.

Now for the *really* bad news. My tumor is called a glioblastoma. It's cancer,
it's aggressive and it's incurable. It will kill me.

My road ahead is going to be painful and hopefully long. And we will need
help. I'll need help. My wonderful wife Leanna and son Beckett will need
help and your love.

Today, (April 10th), I'll undergo a 2nd brain surgery at Duke University. I'm lucky
to be cared for by the absolute best brain tumor team in the world. 

## SymfonyCasts: Still Going Strong

First, yes: SymfonyCasts is healthy. We just finished releasing
our 1st Symfony 7 course, and we're video recording the next, along with a new 
design pattern course. Our team is taking a more active role in the tutorials
and I have plenty of time to train my replacements.

If you are in the Symfony community and are interested in teaching, I would
love to hear from you - message me at `hello@symfonycasts.com`.
