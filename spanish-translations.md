# Automatic Spanish Translations

We're happy to announce that from now on we'll deliver Spanish translations to our new
tutorials (script and subtitles). How we made this possible? You may think that
we hired a professional who takes care of translating the content, well, let me
proudly say that you're wrong. As programmers, we love to automate processes, so, that's
exactly what we did. We leverage the powerful translations service of *DeepL*. DeepL is
a translating cloud service based on an AI algorithm which is surprisingly good. But, 
this time it wasn't as easy as making an API call, we had to heavily customize our 
content so it supports our custom MarkDown syntax and keeping the translations as 
accurate as possible.

Since this is a process run by machines, it's likely that you'll notice "details"
in our translations. So, that's why we also delivered a way where you can easily submit
a fix by sending a pull request. You only need to click on the "Edit on GitHub" button 
which is at the right top corner of the script area, edit the script (or caption) file
and commit the changes.

Thank you for reading, and I hope you will find this helpful.
