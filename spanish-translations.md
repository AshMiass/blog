# Automatic Spanish Translations

We're happy to announce that from now on we'll deliver Spanish translations to our new
tutorials (scripts and subtitles). How did we make this possible? You might think that
we hired a professional who takes care of translating the content. As great as human beings, 
I'm proud to say that you would be wrong! As programmers, we love to automate processes, so, that's
exactly what we did! We leverage the powerful translations service of *DeepL*, which is
a translation service based on an AI algorithm. And... it's surprisingly good! But, 
this time it wasn't as easy as making an API call, we had to heavily customize our 
content so that it supports our custom Markdown syntax and keeps the translations as 
accurate as possible.

Since this is a process run by machines, you'll notice some "misprints" or just... silly translations. 
Machines haven't quite taken over the world yet. But that's ok because we've also delivered a way 
where you can easily help fix an error by sending a pull request to a public GitHub repository.
You only need to click on the "Edit on GitHub" button which is at the right top corner of the script area, 
edit the script (or caption) file and commit the changes.

Thank you for reading, and I hope you will find this helpful.
