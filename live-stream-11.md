# Live Stream #11: Live Stream #11: Turbo Morph Updates & Autocomplete morphing work

In this week's live stream, we get some updates on the "active value"
change in Turbo 8 morphing. Then we dive into work on a PR for the
autocomplete component: making it morph-ready... which is tricky!

* Good news from the week! `:15`
* Turbo's `ignoreActiveValue` Idiomorph change `3:40`
* How to *keep* the user's value in an input during Turbo morphing `8:40`
* The Autocomplete + Morphing PR `14:20`
* Avoid removing the TomSelect changes during morphing `17:50`
* Avoid morphing & reordering the options... so TomSelect doesn't panic `20:10`
* ðŸ’¡ Let's ignore comparing "remote" options during morphing `31:00`
