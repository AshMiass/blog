# 7 Free Screencasts for the Drupal 8 Party

***TIP
**tl;dr** To celebrate Drupal 8, we've created a [Drupal Track](http://knpuniversity.com/tracks/drupal)
and made it free until Dec 25. Watch screencasts, practice with the coding challenges
and spread the love!
***

Drupal 8 will finally be released on [November 19th](https://www.drupal.org/node/2605142).
From the Symfony perspective, this has been an amazing thing to watch full of brilliant
people that have come into my life as a result. But that deserves its own post. 
The point is this: I'm *exceedingly* excited about Drupal 8, and I want you to be
too.


## The New Drupal 8 Tutorial Track

[http://knpuniversity.com/tracks/drupal](http://knpuniversity.com/tracks/drupal)

If you already know Drupal, then learning Drupal 8 really means learning new practices
and paradigms that will ultimately make you a better developer, no matter what you
do. And this is *really* cool stuff!

* Object Oriented Coding
* PHP Namespaces
* Dependency Injection
* Services and Service Containers
* Routes & Controllers
* Event Listeners
* Twig

Instead of being scary, these topics should be *exciting* and accessible. That's
why we added a brand new [Drupal 8 Track](http://knpuniversity.com/tracks/drupal).

And, we're making this entire track **100% free until December 25th, 2015**.

That's **4 hours** of video and over **50 coding challenges** aimed to get you over
the hump of the "new stuff" and back to work.

If you find this help, we will <3 you for telling your Drupal friends. What else
do you want to see covered?
