# SymfonyCon 2018 Lisbon Videos are Here

Last month, the SymfonyCasts team had the privilege of attending [SymfonyCon 2018](https://lisbon2018.symfony.com/)
with over 900 people from the Symfony community! If you were there, I hope we met you!

The conference featured over 25 speakers and, even if you attended, it's pretty
hard to catch all the talks... across 3 simultaneous tracks (if you did, let me know
your secret!). Fortunately, our friends at Symfony recorded all of the talks. And,
starting today, these are being released right here on SymfonyCasts free for anyone 
who attended the conference or for subscribers.

## I want the Videos!

Ready to watch the videos? Go, go, go!

https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/symfonycon2018

We'll be releasing these as soon as they're ready over the next few weeks - so
watch closely!

If you attended the conference, [log in with your Symfony Connect](https://symfonycasts.com/login/sensiolabs)
account for access. Or, **if you already have an account** here, click the
"Connect with Symfony" button [on your profile](https://symfonycasts.com/profile/show).
The videos are also available to all active SymfonyCasts subscribers.

If you have any questions or issues, as always, you can message us, say hi, or tell
us random cool science facts at `hello@symfonycasts.com`.

## Scripts & Subtitles too!?

But wait, there's mooooooore! I'm also really proud that we're able to release not only
the videos, but the **full script** (free for everyone) and **English Subtitles**
on all videos. As wonderful as all the speakers are... even I need a little bit of
help understanding everything.

By the way, if you find any issue with the captions (some parts were tricky!) you
can contribute those fixes back by sending a pull request to the correct
script file: https://github.com/SymfonyCasts/sfcon2018/tree/master/sfcasts.
