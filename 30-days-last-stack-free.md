# 30 Days of LAST Stack Tutorial Free until Jan 15th

I haven't been this excited about the web in a long time. Layers of complexity
that we learned to live with - Node, Webpack, Babel, combining files, giant
frontend libraries - are being replaced. The new paradigm is simpler, just as
powerful and *incredibly* fun to use.

To celebrate the release of [Symfony 7](https://symfony.com/7) & a stable
[Asset Mapper](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/asset_mapper.html), we're
launching a [30 Days of LAST Stack tutorial](https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/last-stack).
It starts December 1 and will run until the end of the year. Each day,
we'll release a new video that will tackle *real* problems that you face every
day: modals, toast notifications, AJAX everywhere, dynamic forms, data tables
and more.

And, it's all free until January 15th! So tell your friends, spread the front-end
goodness & love your stack in 2024. https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/last-stack
