# KnpUniversity is now SymfonyCasts!

If you look around the site today, you'll probably notice something different.
KnpUniversity is *now* SymfonyCasts! *And* SymfonyCasts is the official online
training system for Symfony. This is something we've been planning for awhile and
we are *beyond* excited. Like, jumping-high-fives-someone-order-a-big-cake kind
of excited! Woh.

If you're already a KnpU/SymfonyCasts user: we <3 you! And because of that, I want
to explain *exactly* what this change means (and doesn't mean). Question & answer
time!

**A) So... What Changed Exactly?**

Basically, our name :). Well, a bit more than that (keep reading). But, we are
**the same team**, creating the **same aweome tutorials** and we are the **same company**. 

**B) Was KnpUniversity acquired?**

Nope! Same team, same content, but with closer ties to the Symfony Organization :).

**C) What is Dark Energy?**

Hmm. Seems a bit unrelated! But, sure! I'm no expert, but I believe this is the
mysterious force that's used to explain the fact that the universe is expanding
at a faster and faster rate.

## Hello SymfonyCasts!

So what *is* changing? When we started KnpUniversity 7 years ago, we wanted to help
make Symfony accessible to more people with high-quality, tutorial-based videos.
We use this style to create the best [PHP tutorials](https://symfonycasts.com/tracks/php),
[OO tutorials](https://symfonycasts.com/tracks/oo) and a fantastic
[JavaScript series](https://symfonycasts.com/tracks/javascript). But, we've always
kept Symfony at the center of what we do. What can we say, we love Symfony!

So, when we were asked if we wanted to become the official screencasts for
Symfony, it made perfect sense! This means SymfonyCasts will have more exposure
on Symfony.com so that new Symfony users can find our tutorials faster. It also
means we get to work more closely with Symfony: making sure our tutorials move
in sync.

## Supporting Symfony through SymfonyCasts

But, there is one *totally* different reason that I'm excited. Now that SymfonyCasts
has joined Symfony, supporting SymfonyCasts now helps to support the development
of Symfony itself. This is an important detail that helps to make sure the Symfony
ecosystem can sustain itself far into the future.

As part of that, SymfonyCasts will sponsor me (Ryan) to work on the official Symfony
Documentation each Friday for the rest of 2019. Yep, SymfonyCasts is now helping
to push the written documentation forward!

## Questions? Confused?

If you have *any* questions about *any* of these, please ask! We want everything
to be as clear and open as possible. You can ask down in the comments, email us at
`hello@symfonycasts.com`, find me (`weaverryan`) on the Symfony Slack or show up
at our office with chocolate ice cream. Your call.

Cheers!
