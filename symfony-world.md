# Symfony World Videos are Available (but not here)

The online [Symfony World conference](https://live.symfony.com/2020-world/) was
a *blast*. Sure, it's even *more* fun to hang out in person, but with a huge set of
great talks, it was a welcome experience for 2020.

If you're looking for the videos, good news! They're already available! *And*,
each has high-quality captions. Booya!

But... they not available on SymfonyCasts. To be fair to everyone who bought tickets,
the videos are being hosted on the conference website for ticket holders only. If
you didn't attend, you can *still* buy a ticket and have full access to the replay.

So, here are the details, in mock interview form:

**Hey Ryan! Where can I watch the conference videos?**

Right here: https://live.symfony.com/account/replay/videos/2020-world

**I didn't attend the conference... can I still watch the videos?**

Yep! You can [buy a conference ticket](https://live.symfony.com/2020-world/registration/) and get full access. As a bonus, this directly supports the Symfony team.

**Did you where shoes during your presentation?**

Of course not! But, apart from that, I was wearing a full tuxedo... probably.

Cheers!
