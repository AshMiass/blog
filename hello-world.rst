The Next Phase: Opening it up, working with you!
================================================

For the past few weeks, I've been *scouring* the web to learn everything I
can about REST. I've spent hours watching presentations, reading blog posts,
scanning RFCs (scary!) and bothering smart people directly. And after all
that time and effort, I'm still putting the pieces together.

Sometimes, learning something technical is just plain hard. Information is scattered,
opinions vary, and best-practices are buried. Nothing tells the whole, realistic
story of how something (fill in any tech topic, REST, Symfony2, Testing, etc) looks
in a real world application.

And **all the information is out there**! It's in blog posts, presentations and the
brains of smart people. So why can't we put it all together into one complete example
of how to do something correctly? We work together on open source libraries we all
use, but why not on real-life tutorials?

Opening up and Collaboration
----------------------------

And even though we're really proud of our tutorials, until now, we've worked on
them in isolation. In fact, almost everyone on the web operates around this old
idea of writing and releasing content in isolation.

So now, we're excited to enter our next phase, our rebellious, hyper-social,
experimental college years if you will. It's less about us, and a lot more about
finding out how we can work together.

What do I mean? Let's use some friendly bullet points:

* **Opening up on GitHub** - Until now, the script and code have been
  totally closed. That means that if you find a typo or thought something
  could be explained better, making the change was impossible. That's silly,
  so we're changing that. You can peak at `our GitHub`_. We're also going
  to open source more code and parts of the KnpUniversity site itself. In
  fact, this blog is `sourced from GitHub`_

* **Coding Activities** - We believe that learning should always be example
  based, which in the coding world means building tutorials. We also think
  that actually coding (not just watching) is *really* important to truly
  learning this stuff. So, we decided to poke that box by adding activities
  to our :doc:`/screencast/twig/basics` course, with PHP activities coming
  very soon! We're still figuring out how this should all look and work, so
  give us some feedback!

* **Everyone is an Author** - We've always wanted to open up KnpU to have
  content from anyone in the world. We're not there yet, but we *are* working
  with some really smart people (`Brent Shaffer (OAuth)`_, `Saša Stamenković (Sylius)`_)
  on new content. If you've got a topic you know a little bit about, then
  we want to work with you too (email us: hello@knpuniversity.com).

Like when we started, we don't know where this will all lead, but we *do* know
that we're *really* *silly* excited! It means we get to share more and collaborate
with really smart people. And it's a challenge to us to open up as much of our code,
scripts and processes as possible.

A Geeky, Philosophical Thought
------------------------------

We - the dev community - have a *huge* amount of knowledge and many people
who are awesome enough to try to share what they know. This comes in the form
of blog posts, writing open source software, answering questions in a forum,
etc. If we lack anything, it's tutorials, written by the experts, that tackle
real problems from beginning to end. Writing a blog post is pretty easy, but
creating a 5 part tutorial, releasing the code, and then keeping it all up
to date over time is a big pain. We know this because we face it every day :).

That's why our goal is to make **creating and maintaining high-quality tutorials easy**.
Nothing beats learning something new with a great tutorial, we just need
to make writing them simpler.

Thank you

We started KnpUniversity way back in December 2011 to prove that combining
Symfony screencasts with corny humor was a rather silly idea. To make sure
we failed, we originally forced you to download a huge video file (no streaming),
didn't give you a script, and spread out releases over a long period of time.

But somehow, you're still here, reading this. And for that, we're embarrassingly
thankful :).

Cheers!
