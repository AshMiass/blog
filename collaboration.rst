Collaboration in the world of Tutorials
=======================================

You love open source software, right?

What about open source content?

The software Rennaisance is well upon is. Open Source Software and tools like
GitHub let us work together brilliantly. The result is huge gains in quality
and innovation. That's really important.

But content - the documentation, tutorials and books that teach us about all
of this tech - is behind the curve. Yes, official documentation is usually
on a GitHub repository and we see a huge community effort with the
`Symfony documentation`_. Even StackOverlow is an example of crowd-sourcing
the information-side of tech. But mostly, books, blog posts and everything in
between are still written by one person. They sit, slowly rot with time,
and are eventually forgotten. New books are written by new authors from scratch.
The cycle continues.

This cycle is an antique. And like most things that move slowly, the Internet
will fix this. Imagine a world where tutorials are based on real, high-quality
projects written by many people. That's where I want to go.

Colaboration Now
----------------

So, how can we push this forward? We're starting by (being really lucky to)
collaborate with some brilliant people:

* `Brent Shaffer`_ is our partner for the `OAuth 2.0 in 8 Steps`_ tutorial.
  In addition to being our mega-expert, he drew us `ridiculous farming pictures`_.

* `William Durand`_ will work with us in Feb on our `REST tutorial`_.
  This is amazing, because it means having a real-world tutorial written
  by one of the leaders in building technology that helps make RESTy sites.

    And if you're great at something, we want to bring your knowledge to
    life too. Comment here or bother us on `Twitter`_.

What else?

Our screencast and blog content is also open source and lives up on `GitHub`_.
That's actually not new, but the "Edit" button at the top of this page and
the contributers on the right *is* new. Do us all a favor and get your face
up on the site. I even left a typo in this paragraph (though there's probably
on the page). Find it!

Why Don't we all Write More?
----------------------------

If the problem is ultimately that we all need write more, then why don't
we? What stops us from all writing tutorials? Here are some reasons I think:

- There's nowhere easy to publish it (same as blog posts) - not true for everyone;

- It's way more fun to just write code;

- A tutorial and code are disconnected - I need to write an app and *then*
  go back and write it all. I'll have  to copy code into the tutorial, which
  may be wrong or get outdated.

Are these right? Wrong? What stops you from writing a tutorial?

Code collaboration blew up when GitHub made the process easy and rewarding.
I hope we can help do the same for tutorials. Stay tuned.
