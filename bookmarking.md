It's now super easy to remember your favorite course or even video with
our new bookmarking feature. Look for the bookmark icon on the course overview
and video pages. Found something important and don't want to lose it?
Awesome! Just bookmark and find it later under "[My Bookmarks](/profile/bookmarks)".

Also, our [course list page](/courses#all) has a new filter to show only courses that you
bookmarked. And of course, you can combine all the normal filters, e.g.
show only unwatched courses that you bookmarked.

Oh, and thanks to *you* for suggesting this new feature! It's available to
everyone now: just log in and start bookmarking. Don't have a KnpU account yet?
