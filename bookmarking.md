our new bookmarking feature. Look for bookmark icon on course overview
or video pages. Found something important and don't want to lose it
after awhile? Don't worry, just bookmark it into your account.

If you already have a few bookmarks, the latest one is shown on your
activity page below to keep on hand your recently bookmarked course or video.

Also, our course list page have a new filter to show only courses that was
bookmarked by you. And of course, you can combine filter parameters, e.g.
show only unwatched courses that were bookmarked by you.
